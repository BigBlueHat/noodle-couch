# Noodle Couch

Noodle.js screen scraping managed via Apache CouchDB

*NOTE:* Painfully early yet. Don't do anything here, but help out. :wink:

## Idea :bulb:

[Noodle.js](http://noodlejs.com/) is a slick little screen scraping API.

[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is a pretty fabulous document
storage database that likes HTTP and JSON a whole bunch.

Putting them together, I want to enable:
 - write screen scraping requests into CouchDB
 - have noodle.js (asynchronously, ideally) run those scrapping jobs (perhaps
 on a schedule)
 - store the results of the scrape into CouchDB
 - rinse
 - repeat

## Usage

To be posted once it's actually usable. :grin:
